#In this SQL are queries of a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#1. How many orders were placed in January? 
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
;

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product = 'iPhone'
AND length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
;

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 
SELECT distinct cust.acctnum 
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales feb
JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON cust.order_id = feb.orderID
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
;

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 
SELECT distinct Product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE price = (SELECT MIN(price) 
               FROM BIT_DB.JanSales)
;

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT Product, sum(quantity)*price as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product
;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT Product, sum(quantity), sum(quantity)*price as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location in ("548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101")
GROUP BY product
;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
SELECT distinct count(cust.acctnum) as CustomerCount, AVG(quantity*PRICE) as AvgSpending
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales feb
JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON cust.order_id = feb.orderID
WHERE feb.quantity>2 
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
;

#8 Listing all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and including how many of each were sold. 
SELECT Product, SUM(quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location LIKE "%Los Angeles%"
GROUP BY Product
;

#9. Which locations in New York received at least 3 orders in January, and how many orders did they each receive?
SELECT location, count(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE location LIKE "%NY%"
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
GROUP BY location
HAVING count(orderID) >= 3
;

#10. How many of each type of headphone were sold in February?
SELECT Product, SUM(quantity) as quantity
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE Product LIKE "%headphone%"
GROUP BY Product

#11. What was the average amount spent per account in February?
SELECT AVG(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales feb
JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON cust.order_id = feb.orderID
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
;

#12. What was the average quantity of products purchased per account in February? (Hint: just like question 3, we want the overall average, not the average for each account individually).
SELECT SUM(quantity)/count(cust.acctnum)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales feb
JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON cust.order_id = feb.orderID
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
;

#13. Which product brought in the most revenue in January and how much revenue did it bring in total?
SELECT Product, sum(quantity)*price as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product
ORDER BY revenue DESC
LIMIT 1
